# Scholarship-Stipend_Management_System

A web-based system to streamline the management of scholarships and stipends for students using Python (Flask) and MySQL.

## Project Objective

To design a centralized system that efficiently manages student data, scholarship applications, and funding allocations through an interactive web interface and optimized backend database.

## What We Did

- Developed a **MySQL relational database** for student, scholarship, and application information.
- Built a **Flask-based web interface** for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Implemented **B+ Tree indexing** to optimize search and range queries.
- Designed **ER diagrams** and **UML models** to document system architecture.
- Included admin and student modules with proper session handling and role-based access.

## Outcome

- Enabled easy tracking and filtering of student applications based on CPI, income, and eligibility.
- Reduced manual work for administrators by automating scholarship assignment.
- Created a functional and scalable backend with efficient data handling for real-world deployment.
